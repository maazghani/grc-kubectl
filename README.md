# grc-kubectl
Colorized output for kubectl using [grc](https://github.com/garabik/grc).

## Install
* follow setup from grc repo
* copy `grc.conf` and `conf.*` to `~/.grc/`

## Comments
* trying this out, please suggest better tools for colorizing kubectl output if you find one
* not a fan of how grc requires a diff conf file for each different `kubectl` command
